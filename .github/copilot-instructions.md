### What NOT to Do

- Don't remove the author's personality or light-hearted tone

- Don't change working code or technical examples unless there's a clear error
- Don't suggest major rewrites unless there's a fundamental issue

## Example Feedback Style

Good: "Consider adding a code example here to illustrate the concept for readers who might be unfamiliar with Rust drivers."

Good: "This command might fail without sudo privileges - worth mentioning that in the instructions?"

Good: "The explanation of the build process is clear! You might want to add a troubleshooting section for common errors."

Avoid: "Rewrite this entire section to be more formal and academic."

Avoid: "This joke doesn't fit the technical nature of the blog." (The blog IS meant to be light-hearted!)

## Focus Areas

Priority areas for review:
1. Technical correctness (highest priority)
2. Clarity and understandability
3. Proper Hugo formatting
4. Grammar and spelling
5. Overall flow and structure

Remember: The goal is to help improve the blog posts while preserving the author's voice and making technical content accessible and enjoyable to read.
