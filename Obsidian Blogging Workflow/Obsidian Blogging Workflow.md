# Obsidian Blogging Workflow

## Summary

This is my first blogpost and im going to talk about how to make an easy workflow between [[Obsidian]] and [[Hugo]]. I love using [[Obsidian]] and I love taking Notes, now its time to share them with the rest of the Internet. The approach I take is a three stage approach, which is outlined in the diagram below. We will walk our way through this workflow in this blog and outline the tools and the stages as we go through.

The tools and languages you will need during this blog are shown below:

- [[git]] - versioning your blogs and Obsidian Notes
- [[GitHub]] - Hosting your Repositories and publishing your Hugo Blog
- [[Markdown]] - The file format of your blogs
- [[Hugo]] - Turning your [[Markdown]] files into beautiful Web code ([[JavaScript]],[[css]],[[html]])
